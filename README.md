# YAIM904 d28b – Hot or Cold 🎁🔥❄️

---

## 📦 Description

**YAIM904 d28b – Hot or Cold** turns Factorio into a **treasure-hunting mini-game**, inspired by the classic children’s game *hot and cold*.

In each chunk, a hidden reward can be found by following feedback that tells you whether you are getting **hotter or colder** as you move closer to the prize.

This MOD adds a playful exploration mechanic without affecting normal factory gameplay.
